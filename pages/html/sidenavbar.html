		<h1>Fate of Immortality</h1>
		<p>We know very well that every human being on earth fears death, fears that their identity will vanish without
			trace. This may be one of the reasons why we have a very good and convincing theory and stories of
			afterlife. Almost all of the theories out there about afterlife will definitely help you to organize your
			life when you are alive and bear the final fate of anything in the universe (Everything seizes to exist
			after sometime).</p>

		<p>Since the day we were born we start learning and grasping things around us to make our life easier, along the
			way of making sense of our surrounding we see that many things seizes to exist like the dog with whom we
			used to play, old man next to our house with whom we used to talk, etc., some of these memories leave a long
			lasting impression in our heart which we are unable to get rid of, but as we grew older and older and time
			passes by we realizes the inevitability of life and we move on with new things that came into existence in
			our life along with the memory of lost things. That’s why we believe that “The change is the law of nature”
			and “Time is a great healer”.</p>

		<p>Now let’s imagine a story that will depict one of the possibilities that what will happen if one find a way
			to his immortality.</p>

		<p>On 15 June, 1961 a boy was born in a middle-class family, who lives near Moak Lake. The boy was named ‘Marcus
			Pierce’ after fairly long discussion between their parents. Marcus’s father owns a workshop and earns a
			decent amount of money to live a sound life and his mother is very good at making crafts out of crap, this
			is also reflected in their son.</p>

		<p>At the age of seven Marcus had made a contraption that remotely opens and closes a little outside the door
			for his family dog. With the help of his mother and father’s workshop Markus had constantly been building
			toys and mechanical contraption like this one using spare bike parts, old TV, radio, etc.</p>

		<p>8 years later first personal computers were launched in the market and his father brought him one for his
			15th birthday present. Marcus was very happy for the present and after sometime he found himself really
			interested in the newly developing industry called computer. Marcus soon began to create software programs
			for computer and related technology, this made him soon realize that it has a very unique way of
			understanding how technology and human beings can interact and create things that can solve many global
			problems. With his artistic ability and interest, natural ingenuity and understanding for digital world he
			soon began to work very hard to create new software programs. He also sold many of them. Because of his
			intelligence and ability, he was able to seek world’s attention at an early age and appears in several TV
			shows, meets president and graduated from MIT.</p>

		<p>Now, the year is 1989, Marcus loses his mother due to a heart attack. As Marcus’s father is not able to give
			time to Marcus due to his hectic business schedule, his mother is one of the few people on which he really
			counts on and truly love. So, he really started think about his mother’s death and death in general very
			seriously and all of this is making no sense to him and made him wonder why conscious intelligent being like
			us dies like any other creatures. At this point Marcus realized that in near future we have to overcome our
			dependence on weak biological human body through technology. He started to study very hard, developed his
			theories and started working on newly emerging computer software and bio technology.</p>

		<p>After three years of hard work and research he is able to start his own company called ‘Mortal Technology’.
			The company is dedicated for creating algorithm and computer models that mocks human biology, genetics and
			neural systems. Time passes by and he recognizes that human brain is very much similar to the software model
			that he and his company is creating and studying the brain with. Brain recognizes pattern, organize that
			pattern into some hierarchy and then the brain is able to frame its condition and judge accordingly just
			like the newly developed software artificially. From this observation by him, he concluded that if coding of
			human consciousness can fully represent in computer software and replicated then it can be placed on any
			hardware and thus human consciousness can be exist for eternity. In other words, human experience, identity
			and consciousness can exist limitless beyond the limit of biological human body.</p>

		<p>After many years of research and hard work, in 2039 the company has successfully duplicated human brain with
			the help of computer software, bio technology and semi-conductor technology. This means now human
			consciousness can be enhanced, maintained and transferred to any hardware device or cloud. This will
			completely eradicate the problems of mental disorder, bacterial disease and age- related disease. Now we can
			think and perceive surrounding at the rate that is greater than ever, mental and physical condition can be
			modified beyond inherited genetics. But still there are some gaps remaining to completely duplicate the
			human self on any immortal or replicable devices. After some 2-3 years Marcus and his company has
			successfully transferred his consciousness in a hardware that can be replicated at any point of time in
			future.</p>

		<p>Now Marcus can change his synthetic body and reconnect to his self-consciousness through cloud. With this
			ground-breaking technology he leads humanity to a new realm of existence of a life of infinite consciousness
			and most of humanity problem have now been solved by him.</p>

		<p>Now the year is 2595, Marcus is with the rest of humanity spread across the universe, every place where the
			immortal conscious can thrive. Marcus learns every theory, masters every language and skills, watch every
			movie and videos, visits every website, experience every culture in universe that has been in existence,
			falls in love and out love over and over. Millions of years passes by, years become irrelevant. New worlds
			are discovered, ruled, created and explodes. Marcus explores new planet, galaxies, dimensions, matter,
			universe, etc., he meets many new being from new world, experiences new realms of art, science and methods
			of entertainment. He sees all of these things emerging and dying again and again over the billions of years.
			Billions of years passes by almost everything that was with his mortal self have been long forgotten, stored
			away in one of the universes like an old file on one of the technologies that have been invented.</p>

		<p>He explores everything in existence until universe began to die and galaxies began to dissolve. He has
			achieved everything that has been unimaginable dreams for all of humanity and supremacy over nature
			unavoidable fact ‘death’. After all these hustles of billions of billions of years finally he is about to
			die with the universe. In the remaining moments of the dying universe clay decides to create one last thing,
			Marcus begins to construct the blue print for a new universe like rules of a video game, he renders the
			code, he makes it hard but not impossible, long but not without a end, he makes it so that each level gets
			little more complex yet a little more interesting, yet a little more daunting yet a little more rewarding.
			He makes it so the rules of the universe changes little over time, never too far so it makes no sense but
			never to close that it makes complete sense. He hides the end game so far from the starting point, only in
			final stage it can be seen and comprehended. He conceals the truth among the chaos, the logic amidst the
			disorder, the meaning amidst the lack thereof, finally he leaves the possibility for creating a new
			universe. Marcus finishes, it’s perfect he says to himself</p>

		<p>He traveled cosmos, learned everything that was there to learn for what; to die with the universe with
			everything else. What was the point of beating his own death; just to extend his conscious to the end of the
			universe? How could a species which has defended the death, can die with the universe like rest of the
			creature? (The same question has aroused when Marcus’s mother died.)</p>

		<p>Finally, universe began to compress tighter and tighter, dying energy dries out any remaining life, the last
			stars turn off, the last planet explodes, everything gives one last nod, a farewell to this existence as it
			squeezes back in nothingness as energy tightens into a final pinpoint. Marcus’s new universe explode
			bursting colours, matter and energy floods out reversing the nothing into an ever-expanding time and space
			begin again, stars begin to fill the sky, planets forms, life emerges, trial and existence unfold and a
			sequence of living and dying, trying and failing, evolving and adapting, thinking and talking, building and
			creating began years and years would go by and the year is 1968.</p>
